## Politeia Overview

This is the repository for the legacy Decred Politeia service. This service
would save Decred proposal data to this repository, then would episodically
timestamp the git commit hash onto the Decred blockchain.

An addition feature of this service was to sign data that was submitted to it
and return this signature to the client as a "receipt", i.e. cryptographic
proof that the data was received and processed by the server. These receipts
can be found throughout this repository and can be verified using the server
public key shown below.

The politeia v0.2.0 release is the last release that was used to generate the
data in this repository.
